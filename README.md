Project Description

Ruchi helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. Users can also make use of leftovers, pantry staples, and student survival kits to prepare quick, nutritious meals, reducing food wastage.

The Problem Statement

Many people struggle to decide what to cook with available ingredients, often resulting in food wastage or unhealthy takeout. Leftovers and pantry items are frequently ignored, and students or busy individuals find it challenging to plan quick, nutritious meals.

The Solution

Our project solves this problem by letting users input available ingredients, including leftovers and pantry items. Based on these inputs, Ruchi suggests recipes that can be prepared immediately. This makes meal planning simple, reduces food waste, and helps students and busy individuals cook efficiently.
